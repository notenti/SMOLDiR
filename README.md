# What is is?
SMOLDiR is a smart smoke detector for in-home use. It is designed to replace traditional smoke detectors, but leverages an IR camera to provide faster recognition of real, dangerous fires, while reducing the likelihood of false positives.

# The app
SMOLDiR comes with an Android app that provides the user with valuable information. 

### Mulitple Detector Support
The SMOLDiR app supports multiple detectors in a single home. When the user is logged into the app, they'll have a view of all registered detectors in their home network from which they can view the detailed history of.

### Notifications
Each time an event is triggered by SMOLDiR, the user will be notified via a push notification. The notification describes the type of event (low battery, warning, fire, etc.) and the location of said event. The notification will allow the user to directly silence the SMOLDiR if they wish.

### History
Each detector has an available history. Whenever an event is logged, the app will display the event to the user. The information included is: time of event, date of event, type of event, and if applicable, an image of the thermal scene when the event occured.
